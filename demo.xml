			<question>So MemorySurfer supports HTML - isn't this a security |___|? If you use only your own ".imsf" file - rather not.</question>
			<answer>risk
&lt;br>
But using a ".imsf" file of untrusted source would give an potential attacker the possibility to run scripts in your browser, and make all sorts of actions on your behalf (even though i doubt it would be possible to steal your credit card number).</answer></card>

			<question>So MemorySurfer runs on my Raspberry at home or on my VPS - wouldn't this make my computer vulnerable for port scans and such? Sure - but as far as i can tell neither my Raspberry nor my Debian setup have been |___|.</question>
			<answer>hacked
&lt;br>
Which doesn't mean hacking is not possible - there are possibly some "failure cases" and especially the XML parsing might be a good way to hack the system (but people who could do this very likely hack another [more valuable] system instead).</answer></card>

			<question>Is Exporting the .imsf file to .|___| necessary? In case more than 1000 cards are present one Export / Import cycle could improve performance drastically (if it never has done before, and the Cards are shuffled across the .imsf file).</question>
			<answer>XML
&lt;br>
A Export / Import cycle is reordering the internal data structure of the .imsf file according to the order of the Decks / Cards.</answer></card>

			<question>Some Cards are not asked / gone (something is weird) - The program has a bug? Maybe - but you can track your Cards and everything in the .XML via a content |___| (like git).</question>
			<answer>tracker
&lt;br>
That way you can be sure all your cards are OK.</answer></card>

			<question>How many |___| are possible to create? The current implementation has a theoretical limit of about 130000000 |_"_| (for now and the foreseeable future). But this would use up 2 GB of RAM and certainly would run awful slow. Currently, on a Raspberry Pi (3 Model B) a realistic limit I would assume to be 10000 |_"_|.</question>
			<answer>Cards
&lt;br>
But this would involve regularly Exporting and Importing, and keeping the frequently used Decks "at the bottom" (to keep the "distance" for sorting "shorter").</answer></card>

			<question>A Card can be either TXT or |___|.</question>
			<answer>HTML
&lt;br>
For simple text based flashcard TXT is very much sufficient.</answer></card>
		<card>
			<question>Even for a simple TXT card, styling is possible - to overwrite the |___| definition, set the following style:

  div.qa-txt {
    font-family: sans-serif;
  }</question>
			<answer>monospace
The &lt;div>'s for displaying the question and answer of the card use the (CSS) class "qa-txt", which is defined in ms.css as follows:
  div.qa-txt {
    width: 98%;
    padding: 0.5ex 0.2ex 0.5ex 0.2ex;
    margin: 0.3ex auto 0.3ex auto;
    border-width: 1px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-radius: 0.3ex;
    border-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, .25);
    min-height: 2.5em;
    font-family: monospace;
    white-space: pre-wrap;
    overflow-wrap: break-word;
  }</answer></card></deck></memorysurfer>
